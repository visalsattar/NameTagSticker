# NameTagSticker
A repository about my NameTagStcker Projects


Behavior:

1. The page shows multiple name tags with random colors and slight rotations, making each tag unique.
2. After 1 second, the page refreshes, and a new set of name tags with different colors and rotations appears.
3. This project creates an engaging and visually appealing page that dynamically generates and refreshes name tag stickers.
